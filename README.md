# odin-landing-page

This project is based off the [landing page project from The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).

I made it TMNT-themed because I loved watching the 1990's TMNT movie on VHS as a kid.

Things I struggled with while completing this project:
- What to name div classes
- Working with images (I could not figure out how to shrink the main image like I wanted)
- Moving images within a div (I learned about transform: translate)

Questions I still have:
- Is there a best practice for centering content on a page? Using padding worked, but I wondered about that.
- How do I use variables in CSS? Like for the padding values.
- How do I get the main image to shrink but fill the space roughly the height of the original? Like shrink horizontally and maybe zoom a little.
